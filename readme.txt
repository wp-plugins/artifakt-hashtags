This plugin makes #hashtagged keywords searchable across your website.

== Description ==
The artifakt Hashtag Plugin allows you to easily and quickly make keywords
searchable across your website, in the same way it does on other websites
where hashtags are used. Just adding the # symbol in front of a word or phrase
makes it clickable for the user, and when clicked, returns a results page that
shows everywhere that hastag is used on your website. Pretty cool eh?


== Installation ==

1. Upload the 'artifakt-hashtags' folder to your plugins directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. When writing a post simply use hashtags on keywords ( #wordpress ) and they will turn into search links when the post is displayed
